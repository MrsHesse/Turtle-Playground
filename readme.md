# Turtle playground

Good example at [turtlegraphics.fun](https://turtlegraphics.fun/turtle.html).

This library contains the turtle graphic which is useful for new learners.

The source code is available at [github](https://github.com/kirkcarlson/js-turtle)


I also looked at turtleGFX.  This is easy to use, but does not implement
the turtle graphic.
